(0) INSTALL
-----------

To install Variant-Analyzer, open a Linux terminal and run the following commands:

tar xvfz variant-analyzer.tar.gz
cd VARIANT_ANALYZER-1.0
chmod +x scripts/* variant-analyzer.pl

The program itself is a Perl script and requires the following Perl modules to be 
installed on your system:

use Cwd;
use Getopt::Long;
use POSIX;
use File::Basename;
use List::Util;
use Bio::DB::Fasta;
use Bio::Seq;
use Bio::SeqUtils;
use Bio::SeqIO;
use Bio::Seq;

(1) MOTIVATION
--------------

Variant-Analyzer is conceived as an alternative to previous tools that are tightly linked to DBs (e.g. Ensembl, UCSC) and for which 
there is no overall assessment of the impact of co-occurring GVs on protein-coding transcripts. The former makes it hard for people 
working with newly sequenced genomes, genomes that are not available in such databases, or who just have an alternative 
annotation of transcript models for which the impact of different GVs needs to be asssessed. The latter is misleading at the moment of 
evaluating the impact of multiple co-occurring GVs on protein-coding transcripts. For example, a 1 bp insertion and a 1 bp deletion may 
occur on the same transcript, and, if assessed independently, they cause disruption of the ORF, but together cancel each other, 
restoring the ORF. In the same way, 2 substitutions on a same codon may result in a different amino acid change than each substitution 
independently. 

(2) WHAT IT DOES
----------------

Variant-Analyzer takes as input:
 
(i)   transcript models (GFF3 or GTF format), 
(ii)  the genomic DNA where the models reside and (FASTA format) 
(iii) Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV), Insertions (INS) and Deletions (DEL) (collectively called Genomic Variations, or GVs) 

and returns, for each transcript, 

(i)   a summary of all GVs impacting a protein-coding transcript, with a categorization of the Open Reading Frame (ORF) 
      in: INTACT, PRESERVED, DISRUPTED or FULLY_DELETED.
(ii)  the cDNA before (called the reference) and after applying the GVs (called the variant), 
(iii) the reference and variant protein sequence, 
(iv)  an alignment of the reference and variant cDNA at the exon level, 
(v)   a number of basic statistics for each type of GV. 

(3) HOW IT DOES IT
------------------

Variant-Analyzer pursues the following steps:

(4.0) Revises the GV file in order to make sure that they follow the specified format (VCF or TAB). SNV and INS involving non-ACTG are 
discarded. Lines not following the specified format are discarded. (revise-GV-files.pl)
(4.1) Extracts the cDNA for each transcript from the genomic DNA, using the transcript model coordinates, (extract-cDNA.pl)
(4.2) Applies SNPs to the cDNA (apply-SNPs.pl)
(4.3) Categorizes SNPs according to its impact (or not) on protein-coding transcripts (categorize-SNPs.pl).
(4.4) Computes stats on SNPs (get-stats-SNPs.pl)
(4.5) Applies Insertions and Deletions to the cDNA sequences, and computes stats of length distribution 
(apply-insertions-deletions.pl)
(4.6) If the --circos flag is used, it generates the input files for a 
heatmap visualization of each type of GV and for the exons with the Circos 
tool (Krzywinski et al., 2009). The circos data for GVs represents the number
of base pairs inserted or deleted per interval length. The interval length  
is automatically inferred from the genome size (interval length = genome size / 1000).

(4) HOW TO RUN IT
-----------------

 ./variant-analyzer.pl -e EXONS_GFF -r REFERENCE_FASTA (-t GVS_TAB_FORMAT | -v GVS_VCF_FORMAT) [-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [--circos]

The -o and --circos options are optional. Writing Circos data files is pursued as the very last step, after all the genomic variants 
were applied to the transcripts. 

(5) INPUT
---------

Variant-Analyzer takes the following input:

(5.1) A gff3/gtf file with coding_exon sequences

Parameter: -e
Each coding exon should represent a part of a protein-coding transcript, and 
should exclude UTRs.

IMPORTANT: Note that there are NO EXTRA LINES regarding gene/5_prime_UTR/3_prime_UTR/etc in the GFF/GTF input file, and different 
           exons belonging to the same transcript have the same ID.

If the gene attribute is specified ('gene=' in gff3 or 'gene_id' in gtf) then this gene ID is carried over to the VA_transcripts.gff3
output file, which is useful if one wants to know the identity of genes effected by GVs in addition to transcripts IDs.  

As you can see, the relevant columns are 

column1: the chromosome/contig
column4: start coordinate
column5: end coordinate,
column7: strand,
column9: transcript ID

Make sure columns are separated by TAB characters (not spaces). The transcript ID in column9 can be 
preceded by either 'Parent=' , 'ID=' or 'transcript_id '. 

(5.2) A reference genomic DNA file in FASTA format
--------------------------------------------------

Parameter: -r
Self explanatory. Avoid incompatibilities between the transcript coordinates and the chromosomes (e.g. transcripts with coordinates 
out of boundaries, or including transcripts from chromosomes that are not in the fasta file).


(5.3) A list of SNV, INS and DEL in either VCF4.0 format or TAB format
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Parameter: -v (if using VCF4.0 format) or -t (if using TAB format)
the Variant Call Format (VCF) was proposed by the 1,000 genomes project consortium as a standard to report variants. Specifications 
can be found in: 

http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/vcf4.0

The VCF is used by a number of programs that detect SNPs and small indels, including the BCF tools that comes with SAMTools for 
calling SNPs and small indels 

http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml

and Dindel

ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub4/resources/software/dindel/manual-1.01.pdf

The TAB format is an alternative for the cases where the user doesn't have a VCF file. It is a tab-separated file meant to be easy to 
generate. 

An example of a SNV line in the TAB input:

SNP	chr1	10469	C	G 

column1: SNP indicates it is a single basepair difference between the reference and the variant.
column2: chromosome/contig
column3: coordinate within chromosome/contig
column4: reference nucleotide at that coordinate
column5: variant nucleotide at that coordinate

An example of an INS line in the TAB input:

INS	chr1	719490	719491	ATAAT

column1: INS indicates it is an insertion in the variant compared to the reference.
column2: chromosome/contig
column3: start coordinate within chromosome/contig
column4: end coordinate within chromosome/contig 
column5: insertion sequence

Note1: even though insertions are usually annotated to occur between 2 adjacent basepairs X and X+1, this is not required by 
Variant-Analyzer. If the start and end coordinate are separated by 1 or more basepairs, the region in between is regarded as a 
deletion associated with the insertion. For example, if the insertion is annotated to occur betwen basepairs 10 and 20, then basepairs 
11 to 19 will be deleted.

An example of a DEL line in the TAB input:

DEL	chr1	768120	768122

column1: DEL indicates it is a deletion in the variant compared to the reference.
column2: chromosome/contig
column3: start coordinate within chromosome/contig
column4: end coordinate within chromosome/contig

All base pairs from start to end (including start AND end) are deleted in the variant.

Note2: for INS and DEL the start coordinate HAS to be lesser or equal than the end coordinate, otherwise it will be discarded.

(5.4) Specifying the output directory
-------------------------------------
Parameter: -o
Optional parameter that specifies the output directory for Variant-Analyzer output files. If the specified output directory 
does not exist, Variant-Analyzer creates it. If omitted, output files are written to a subdirectory in the current directory
named "output_YYYYMMDD_hhmmss", whereas YYYY, MM, DD, hh, mm, ss denote year, month, day, hour, minute, and second of the
current date/time.

(6) OUTPUT
----------

Assuming that your files are called:

REFERENCE: the genomic DNA
GVs: the list of Genomic Variations in either format

(6.1) VA_transcripts.gff3 and VA_categorized_GVs.gvf
 
The Generic Feature Format Version 3 (GFF3) is a widely used and accepted format for representing genomic features such as trnascript 
models and others. The Genome Variation Format (GVF) is an extension of GFF3 and it is designed to 
describe the impact of Genomic Variants such as SNV, INS and DEL on different genomic features described in a GFF3 file. Hence, both 
files are meant to contain complementary information. More details and specifications for both formats can be found at

http://www.sequenceontology.org/

Given this, Variant-Analyzer provides two outputs:

(6.1.1) VA_transcripts.gff3

An example of a transcript in the VA_transcript.gff3 file is shown here:

chr20   variant_analyzer        mRNA    11790883        11830259        .       -       .       ID=ENST00000427835;Note=snp_746931(conservative_missense_codon),ins_66552,del_83066,ORF_DISRUPTED(15.53)
chr20   variant_analyzer        coding_exon     11790883        11791087        .       -       .       Parent=ENST00000427835
chr20   variant_analyzer        coding_exon     11830155        11830259        .       -       .       Parent=ENST00000427835


For each transcript,Variant-Analyzer provides the coordinates of the overall coding region (mRNA) together with the coordinates for 
each coding exon. In the first line, The Note tag is used to describe , in a comma separated format,

- all snps impacting the protein-coding transcript, and its categorization,
- all insertions impacting the protein-coding transcript,
- all deletions impacting the protein-coding transcript,
- the overall impact of ALL GVs on the ORF (ORF_INTACT/ORF_DISRUPTED/ORF_PRESERVED/FULLY_DELETED)
- if the ORF is found disrupted by the GVs provided as input, then a percentage in parenthesis indicates the location within the 
protein where the stop codon occurs. 

ORF_INTACT: the coding region of the transcript is not impacted by GVs.
ORF_PRESERVED: the overall impact of GVs on the variant transcript is such that it doesn't introduce an early stop codon, compared to 
the reference.
ORF_DISRUPTED: the overall impact of GVs on the	variant transcript is such that it introduces an early stop codon, compared to  
the reference. 
FULLY_DELETED: the variant transcript is such that only two, one or zero base pairs of the coding region remain after a deletion 
event.

Note: the information associated to each GV listed in the GFF3 file (e.g. snp_746931) can be found in the VA_categorized_GVs.gvf file.

(6.1.2) VA_categorized_GVs.gvf

An example of a SNV, INS and DEL in the VA_categorized_GVs.gvf file is shown:

chr15   variant_analyzer        SNV     80988136        80988136        .       +       .       ID=snp_14204;
Variant_seq=G;Reference_seq=C;Variant_effect=non_conservative_missense_codon 0 mRNA ENST00000258884,ENST00000424700;
Note=tgc>tgG_C>W_aa122_codon_loc3_RADICAL(215),tgc>tgG_C>W_aa122_codon_loc3_RADICAL(215)
chr14   variant_analyzer        insertion       90740444        90740445        .       +       .       ID=ins_1;Variant_seq=G;Reference_seq=~;Variant_effect=frameshift_variant 0 mRNA ENST00000380590
chr14   variant_analyzer        deletion        94935764        94935766        .       +       .       ID=del_9;Variant_seq=-;Reference_seq=~;Variant_effect=inframe_variant 0 mRNA ENST00000380365,ENST00000337425,ENST00000448305

- For each case, columns 1, 4 and 5 represent the chromosome, start and end coordinate of the GV.

In column 8:
- Variant_seq represents the variant sequence for this GV.
- Reference_seq represents the reference sequence for each GV.
- Variant_effect represents the effect that this GV has TOGETHER WITH ALL OTHER GVs IMPACTING THIS TRANSCRIPT according to the GVF 
format. Hence, if a (for example) 
deletion by itself disrupts the ORF of the transcript, but the ORF is restored by an insertion downstream, then the Variant_effect 
field will be "inframe_variant". All GVs impacting a transcript are found in the corresponding GFF3 file.
- The "Note=" tag for SNPs can be lengthy and it displays the following information:
-- codon_reference>codon_variant. Note that this codon can come from the + or - strand of the genomic DNA. 
-- aa_reference>aa_variant.
-- location of the SNP within the codon (1,2 or 3).
-- functional impact of the amino acid change for mis-sense mutations together with the associated Grantham Scorein parenthesis.


(7) TIPS FOR RUNNING VARIANT-ANALYZER FASTER
--------------------------------------------

Some steps of Variant-Analyzer can take time when run on very large (human sized) data files. However, even in this case 
Variant-Analyzer should return results in a reasonable amount of time (~1h). One way to speed up execution is to run 
Variant-Analyzer for different chromosomes separately. Also, consider commenting out lines in the variant-analzer.pl script
if re-running a particular step of the analysis is not required. For example, by commenting out the line executing
the 'extract-cDNA.pl' script, Variant-Analyzer would not extract cDNA sequences when it is run again.
